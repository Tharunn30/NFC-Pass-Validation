**NFC Based Pass Validation** is a robust, secure, and contactless solution for validating digital passes using **Near Field Communication (NFC)** technology. This project aims to modernize entry systems with a quick, easy-to-use, and highly scalable platform.

---

## 🔥 Key Features  
- **Contactless Authentication:** NFC-based entry system ensures seamless validation.
- **Fast & Secure:** Reduces wait times and minimizes the risk of fraud.
- **Scalable Solution:** Ideal for events, offices, public transport, and secure facilities.
- **Customizable:** Easily integrates with existing systems or apps.
- **User-Friendly:** Minimal interaction required for both users and administrators.

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. **NFC Scanning:** The user scans their NFC-enabled pass at the validator.  
2. **Validation:** The system checks the pass against a pre-verified database.  
3. **Access Granted/Denied:** If valid, access is granted, and logs are updated. If invalid, the system denies entry and alerts administrators.
